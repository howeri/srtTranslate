00:00:00,483 --> 00:00:01,134
Hmm...not allowed

2
00:00:01,134 --> 00:00:02,318
no no no go away

3
00:00:02,318 --> 00:00:03,536
Go away...wait

4
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:05,121
Ah...

5
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:08,124
Hello everyone

6
00:00:08,124 --> 00:00:08,925
I am Lucy

7
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:09,626
Welcome to my

8
00:00:09,626 --> 00:00:11,778
ClassyChoice boutique selection

9
00:00:14,564 --> 00:00:17,300
Today I am going to unbox a bag!

10
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,668
This bag is

11
00:00:18,668 --> 00:00:22,022
one that I have unboxed on my channel before

12
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,491
and my friend has a different color one

13
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:25,191
I think this color

14
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:27,060
is also a favorite of many people

15
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,096
so I borrowed it from him to unbox for you to see

16
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:32,365
and I will also share how to style it with this bag

17
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:36,986
using 12 items to create outfits for my week of 7 days

18
00:00:36,986 --> 00:00:39,689
Alright, first let's take a look at this bag

19
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:43,126
What kind of bag do you think it is based on its size

20
00:00:47,263 --> 00:00:50,266
Mini Roulis pig nose bag

21
00:00:50,266 --> 00:00:52,619
 I have unboxed it in another video

22
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:54,721
A denim blue pig nose bag

23
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,140
And this one is golden brown

24
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,992
It is the same as the other one I unboxed

25
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,693
Denim blue pig nose bag

26
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:02,429
They all have white stitching

27
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,898
I think the design with white stitching is super pretty

28
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,167
Let me show you the leather in detail

29
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,135
It is also made of Evercolor leather

30
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:10,887
The shoulder strap is hidden inside

31
00:01:10,887 --> 00:01:12,105
I will take it out to show you later

32
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:15,158
In the other unboxing video of the pig nose bag

33
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,160
I have already measured its length, width, and height

34
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,662
I introduced some details of this bag to everyone

35
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,047
So in this video

36
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:22,365
I won't repeat it again

37
00:01:22,365 --> 00:01:23,133
In the previous video

38
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:25,552
I did not test its capacity for everyone to see

39
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:26,336
Some people say

40
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,922
They want to see the capacity of the pig nose bag

41
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,924
 So now I'll use my friend's bag

42
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:31,991
to actually pack!

43
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:32,976
Let me show you

44
00:01:32,976 --> 00:01:35,995
The main compartments inside look like this

45
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:37,497
There are two big compartments

46
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:39,899
And a small compartment in the middle

47
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:42,552
There is also a small compartment at the back of the bag

48
00:01:42,552 --> 00:01:44,454
First, the phone

49
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:46,322
Wallet

50
00:01:46,322 --> 00:01:47,957
My Calvi Duo

51
00:01:49,292 --> 00:01:51,528
Antibacterial spray

52
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:52,929
Hand cream

53
00:01:52,929 --> 00:01:54,197
Lip balm

54
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:55,999
Lipstick

55
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,053
Let me show you how it looks when it's all packed

56
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:01,521
Actually, it's still okay here

57
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,072
Let's add a cushion foundation

58
00:02:03,072 --> 00:02:04,874
If we move the lipstick here

59
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:07,343
And there's also a little space here

60
00:02:07,343 --> 00:02:09,145
This part is actually quite loose

61
00:02:09,145 --> 00:02:11,314
 If you move the things up

62
00:02:12,682 --> 00:02:13,650
It's also fine

63
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,036
Then closing it won't be difficult.
